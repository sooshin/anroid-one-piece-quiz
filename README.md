# Quiz App
Project as a part of Android Basics Nanodegree at Udacity

### Project Overview
The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice. 
We want you to be creative about how you accomplish this. Itâ€™s up to you what the quiz questions will be about 
and how you want to present them to your user.
